# üöß FullCycle rate limiter

Rate Limiter challenge: Basic implementation of rate limiter middleware and tested
using [üîó golang chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi).

# üè≠ How it works?

- We have this structure to handle the requests:
  ```go
  // RateLimiter is a struct that implements rate limiting logic.
  // It's designed to limit the number of Requests allowed within a specified time window.
  type RateLimiter struct {
      // Requests is a slice of time.Time that holds the timestamps of the incoming Requests.
      // It is used to keep track of the Requests that have been made and whether a new request
      // should be allowed or not based on the timing of previous Requests.
      Requests []time.Time
  
      // TimeWindowSec specifies the duration in SECONDS of the time window for which the Requests are counted.
      // For instance, if TimeWindow is set to 60, the RateLimiter will only consider
      // the number of Requests in the last minute.
      TimeWindowSec int64
  
      // MaxRequests defines the maximum number of Requests that are allowed within the TimeWindow.
      // For example, if we have TimeWindowSec = 1 and MaxRequests = 100, we obtain the max request limit 100 req/s
      // Other example, if we have TimeWindowSec = 60 and MaxRequests = 100, we obtain the max request limit 100 req/min
      MaxRequests int
  
      // lock is a mutex that ensures that access to the Requests slice is synchronized across multiple goroutines.
      lock sync.Mutex
  }
  ```


- **Start Request:** The process begins when a client makes a request to any endpoint.
- **Save Request:** The request is saved in Redis, which is a key-value store often used to manage session state or
  perform rate limiting. Redis stores the request information associated with the client's IP address.
- **Request has API key?:** The system checks if the request contains an API key. If it does, the flow continues with
  the API key path; if not, it checks if there's an existing entry for the IP or API key.
- **API key or IP exist?:** The system queries Redis to see if there's an existing record for the API key or IP address.
  If there is no existing entry, it creates a new instance in Redis for tracking.
- **Add request in the request list:** If an entry for the API key or IP address exists, the new request is added to the
  list associated with that key or IP in Redis. This list keeps track of all the requests within a certain time window.
- **Verify Blocked Duration:** Before proceeding, the system checks if the client has been blocked due to exceeding the
  rate limit. If the client is currently blocked, the process ends and fails.
- **Verify Limit:** If the client is not blocked, the system checks if the current request exceeds the set rate limit (
  the maximum number of allowed requests in the time window).
- **Continue to the endpoint/End:** If the request does not exceed the rate limit, the process continues to the
  endpoint, meaning the API will handle the request as usual. If the rate limit is exceeded, the process ends,
  indicating that the request will not be processed, and typically the client would receive a rate-limiting error 
  response.

# üèîÔ∏è Environment variables and configuration

## IP configuration

- We have this env file called `./env.json.example`:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "port": "8080"
  },
  "redis": {
    "db": 0,
    "host": "redis",
    "port": "6379"
  },
  "rate_limiter": {
    "by_ip": {
      "time_window": 1,
      "max_requests": 10,
      "blocked_duration": 60
    }
  }
}
```

where:

- `time_window`: is the value of **SECONDS** that we can allow the maximum amount of request.
- `max_requests`: is the maximum amount of request that we can allow each `time_window` seconds. in the example, we have 
  that the maximum number of requests is `10` each `1 second`.
- `blocked_duration`: is the number of **SECONDS** that the IP is blocked, so we do not allow requests from this IP.

## API Token configuration

In the case of API token, we can create a new token by using this http request:

```http request
POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api-key
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "time_window": 1,
  "max_requests": 100,
  "blocked_duration": 600
}
```

Or you can use a cURL:

```shell
curl -s \
  -X POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "time_window": 1,
    "max_requests": 10,
    "blocked_duration": 60
  }' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api-key
```

Each token has different configuration.

# üöÄ Starting the application!

- Execute the command `make prepare`, this will copy the default configuration.
- Before you execute the docker compose command, you can edit the `env.json` configuration file with your onw values.
- Finally, you can execute using the command `make run`.

# üíø Redis DB

Here, we'll explain about the keys stored in redisDB. We are
using [üîó this redis UI](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) to see the data. We have these keys:

## API Key keys

- `<apikey>`: we have this to store the configuration data of each API Key, we have this value as example:
    - key: `880d207159a7ac1a5a800eabbb310cf851e3c00cb5a2ff6e1ab9f38ce21bcc99`,
    - value:
      ```json
      {
        "max_requests": 10,
        "time_window": 1,
        "blocked_duration": 60
      }
      ```
- `rate:api-key_<apikey>`: We have this to store the rates for the given `<apikey>`, we have this value as example:
    - key: `rate:api-key_880d207159a7ac1a5a800eabbb310cf851e3c00cb5a2ff6e1ab9f38ce21bcc99`,
    - value:
      ```json
      {
        "max_requests": 10,
        "time_window_sec": 1,
        "requests": [
          1704787618,
          1704787619,
          1704787620,
          1704787621
        ]
      }
      ```
- `blocked:api-key_<apikey>`: We have this to store the amount of time that the `<apikey>` is blocked and doesn't
  receive more requests, we have this value as example:
    - key: `blocked:api-key_880d207159a7ac1a5a800eabbb310cf851e3c00cb5a2ff6e1ab9f38ce21bcc99`
    - value: `APIKeyBlocked`.
    - This key has a duration in the redis database, this duration is the value of `blocked_duration` saved in the
      API Key configuration data.

## IP keys

- `rate:ip_<ip>`: We have this to store the rates for the given `<ip>`, we have this value as example:
    - key: `rate:ip_127.0.0.1`,
    - value:
      ```json
      {
        "max_requests": 10,
        "time_window_sec": 1,
        "requests": [
          1704787618,
          1704787619,
          1704787620,
          1704787621
        ]
      }
      ```
- `blocked:ip_<ip>`: We have this to store the amount of time that the `<ip>` is blocked and doesn't
  receive more requests, we have this value as example:
    - key: `blocked:ip_127.0.0.1`
    - value: `IPBlocked`
    - This key has a duration in the redis database, this duration is the value of `rate_limiter.by_ip.blocked_duration`
      saved in the `./env.json` configuration data.

# üß™ How can I test?

To learn more about the CLI using for test, you can run this:

```shell
docker compose run --rm go-cli-test -h
```

## Testing with IP:

Using docker you can run this command:

```shell
docker compose run --rm go-cli-test -url http://go-app:8080/hello-world -m GET -t 1 -r 10
```

## Testing with API key

- First, you need to execute this http request in order to create your API key and set its configuration:
   ```http request
    POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api-key
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "time_window": 1,
      "max_requests": 10,
      "blocked_duration": 60
    }
   ```
- You will receive the response something like this (the api-key will be different)
   ```json
    {
      "api-key": "c6f7363326f62f2483756447a963f2369a0dd5e90b7e8a36c32bc1a62ed38f51"
    }
   ```
- Copy the value of `api-key` and execute the following command, you should put your own token in the `-k` flag.
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm go-cli-test -url http://go-app:8080/hello-world-key -m GET -t 1 -r 10 -k c6f7363326f62f2483756447a963f2369a0dd5e90b7e8a36c32bc1a62ed38f51
   ```

- If you need to execute at the same time, please execute this shell script file: `./run.sh`, you need to install `jq`.
